# Pacman Capture the Flag with MCTS
Welcome to our project repository where we explore the integration of advanced artificial intelligence strategies in classic game environments. In this project, we focus on developing an AI agent for the game of Pacman Capture the Flag (CTF), utilizing the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to enhance decision-making processes.

# Project Overview
Pacman CTF is a variant of the traditional Pacman game, which introduces a competitive aspect by dividing the map into two halves with each team trying to capture the opposing team's flags. The challenge lies in navigating the maze, avoiding or capturing opponents, and strategizing the best routes for defense and attack.

Our project aims to create a robust AI agent that can analyze the game environment, predict opponent moves, and calculate optimal strategies using MCTS. The MCTS algorithm offers a promising approach to handle the complexity of real-time decision-making in the dynamic environment of Pacman CTF.

# Features
MCTS Implementation: Implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, tailored to the specific challenges and rules of Pacman CTF.
Real-Time Decision Making: Our AI agent is designed to perform complex decision-making in real-time, adapting strategies based on game dynamics.
Strategy Optimization: Continuous improvement and learning from each game iteration, enhancing strategies through experience.
Visualization Tools: Tools to visually analyze the decision-making process and strategy evolution of the AI agent throughout the game.
# How It Works
The repository contains all the necessary modules to run the Pacman CTF game with our MCTS-based AI agents. The MCTS algorithm is integrated into the AI’s decision-making loop, where it simulates various possible outcomes to choose the most promising move at each step of the game.
