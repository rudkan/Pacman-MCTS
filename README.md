# Pacman-MCTS
Welcome to our project repository where we explore the integration of advanced artificial intelligence strategies in classic game environments. In this project, we focus on developing an AI agent for the game of Pacman Capture the Flag (CTF), utilizing the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to enhance decision-making processes.
